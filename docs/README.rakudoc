B<COMMENTS OR SUGGESTION ARE ALWAYS WELCOMED BY THE AUTHOR>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Calendar::Jewish;

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Calendar::Jewish> is a collection of calendar data suitable for
I<perpetual> calendar creation. (The term I<perpetual> is used to mean
the source code to generate the calendar's holiday dates is valid for
any given year since the code uses the documented rules for
determining those dates and no additional data need be inserted in the
code annually.)

The Jewish year is comprised of seven-day weeks diveded into 12 months
of varying length. It is a I<lunisolar> calendar and varies
considerably from year-to-year compared to the Gregorian calendar.
The following tables show the data used in this module. Names are from
the I<Academy> rules which are promulgated by the Israeli government.
Table 2 lists the month names and abbreviations used by Raku module
B<Date::Calendar::Hebrew> which is used by this module for
calculating the Gregorian Date from the Jewish date.
